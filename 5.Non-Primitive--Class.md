# What is class?
>***Class*** combines relative data(fields) and functions(methods) together  
>***We can create objects to use the class but we need to allocate storage for them.***   

# How to declare a class(including its fields and functions)?
>For class: ***Modifier class Identifier***
```
public class Person
```
>For fields and functions: ***Modifier Keywords Identifier***
```
public string FirstName;  //Declaring Data
public int Age;    //Declaring Data
public void Instruction(string[] args)         //Declaring Function
```
tips: `public` is used to make he class accessible. 

# How to use the class or the functions in the class?
> Use the Name of class to create new object  
> Use `new.Name` to allocate storage  
> Use **NewNameOfObject.DataName** and **NewNameOfObject.FunctionName** to declare the new data and use the function.
```
Person John = new.Person();  //assume the name of the class is Person and new. is used to allocate storage.
John.FirstName = "John";  //declare the data of object John
John.Age = 23;              
Jhon.Instruction();       //use the function of Person.Instruction
```

# What is static(one of the modifier)?
>With static modifier, we can accesss a member without create a object
```
namespace Classes.Math
{
    public static class Calculator
    {
        public static int Add(int a, int b)
        {
            return a + b;   
        }
    }
}
```
>We can directly use the Add function in the Calculator class
```
int result = Calculator.Add(2,3);
```

# What is struct?
> It is a similar type to class which also include fields and methods     
> We use struct when we create thousands or ten of thousands of small lightweight object
