# How many kinds of Type Conversion?
> 1. Implicity Conversion  
> 2. Explicity Conversion  
> 3. Non-compatible Types Conversion  

# What is implicity conversion?
>When there is no possibility of data loss, we use implicity conversion. (convert from small to big)  
```
byte b = 1;
int i = b;
float f = i;
```
>In the second line convert b from byte to int and in the third line convert i from int to float **BUT** the types of b and f don't change.
 
# What is explicity convbersionm?
>When there is possibility of data loss, we use explicity conversion. (convert from big to small)
```
int b = 1;
byte i = (byte)b;
```
>In the second line convert b from int to byte **BUT** the type of b doesn't change.  
```
float f= 1.3f;
int i= int(f);
```
>In the second line convert f from float to int **BUT** the tpye of f doesn't change.   

# What is non-compatible types conversion?
>The tpye of integral and the type of charactor is non-compatible.
>We use `int.Parse` or **Convert** function like:
```
Convert.ToByte()  //to byte
Convert.ToInt16() //to short
Convert.ToInt32() //to int
Convert.ToInt64() //to long
```
For example:
```
string s = "1";
int i = Convert.ToInt32(s);
int j = int.Parse(s)
```
>Convert s from string to int just in that line **BUT** the origibal tpye of s doesn't change.

# How about overflow?
>When there is an overflow, there will be a exception happenning and we can use **try** and **catch** to handle the exception.
```
try
(
  string str = "1234";
  byte a = Convert.ToByte(str);
  Console.Writeline(a);
)
catch(Exception)
{
  Console.Writeline("It can not be converted to a byte type.")
}
```
