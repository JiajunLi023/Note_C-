### How to declear a Date and Time?
```
var dataTime = new DateTime(2022, 1, 6);  // Creat a date what you want.
var now = DateTime.Now;                   //use DateTime class to set now date and time. Concluding date and time
var today = DateTime.Today;               //use Datetime class to set today's date but no time.
```
   
>tips: After you set the datetime, it is immutable/unchangable so we need to use function to add or subtract.   
>***Attention: after the addition or subtraction, the original value don't change, and you can just set the new value to new variable.***
```
var tomorrow = now.AddDays(1);            // Days can be changed to seconds,minutes,hour....
var yestoday = now.AddDays(-1);

```

### How to output the DateTime?
```
ConsoleWriteLine(now.ToLongDateString()); 
ConsoleWriteLine(now.ToLongDateString());  
Console.WriteLine(now.ToLongTimeString());
Console.WriteLine(now.ToShortTimeString());
Console.WriteLine(now.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm")); // You can choose the format you want to output. 
```
