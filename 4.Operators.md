# How many kinds of operators?
>1. Arithmatic operators: **+add&nbsp; -sub&nbsp; \*mul&nbsp; /div&nbsp; %reminder&nbsp; ++incrementa=a+1&nbsp; --decrementa=a-1**    
>2. Comparison operators: **==equal&nbsp; !=not equal&nbsp; \<less than&nbsp; >more than&nbsp; <=less or equal&nbsp; >=more or equal**  
>**a += 3** means **a = a + 3** 
>3. Assignment operators: **=&nbsp; +=&nbsp; -=&nbsp; \*=&nbsp; /=&nbsp;**  
>4. Logical operators: **&&and&nbsp; ||or&nbsp; !not**  
>5. Bitwise operator:**&and&nbsp; |or**

# Two tpye of increment and derement?
>1.Postfix  
```
int a= 1;
int b = a++;
```
>Result: a = 2, b = 1  
>2.Prefix  
```
int a = 1;
int b = ++1;
```
>Result: a = 2. b = 2.  

# What the difference of Logical and Bitwise?
> Logical operators is used for condition judgment and bitwise operator is used for low level programming
